# Dividend-Calculator

A small dividend calculator in Python because I like doing stocks so why not

***Works with manual inputs as of now***

### What's the point of this?
I assume you want to earn profit overtime through dividends and that you would also reinvest the earnings, therefore earning more later on. 
This calculator does that and also shows four things per quarter:
* Initial Amount
* Quarterly Profits
* # of shares you can reinvest from
